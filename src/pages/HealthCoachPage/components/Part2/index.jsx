                    1- Review the 6 categories on your Life Balance Wheel.
                    If necessary they can split or rename category segments to add in something that is missing, or make it more meaningful for them.
                    2- Rank your level of satisfaction with each area of your life by drawing a curved line across each segment . Scoring is between 1 (very dissatisfied) and 10 (fully satisfied).<br/>
                    
                    TIP: It can be helpful to demonstrate how to draw the line and add each score to their wheel.
                    The new perimeter of the circle represents your "Wheel of Life".  look at your completed wheel and ask, "If this was your Wheel of Life, would it be a bumpy ride?"
                    Finally, identify at least one action to work on to improve your scores on the wheel—and improve your life balance.
